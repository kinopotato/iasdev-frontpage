    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <h3>How do I join a project, exactly?</h3>
    <p>Join the FB group then "vote" for the current project polls. Voting for the project means you want to be a member of that project. For more details on the project, you will have to go to the GitHub page. It's not streamlined yet but we are working on it.
    </p>
    
    <h3>How do I submit a proposal?</h3>
    <p>
Join our discord! We have the channel #project-proposals and fill out this template:

Project Name: [What is your app or website called? ]
Description: [Describe your project and its features] 
Team requirements: [What roles do you need for that project and how many members?] 
Tech Tools to use: [What are the technologies you are going to use for your project?]
    </p>
