    <h2 class="wrapper__text--big">FAQs</h2>

    <div>
      <h3>how do I reach your group?</h3>
      <p class="wrapper--border-bottom">you can reach us through our Facebook group or Github dev team page as well as our Discord channel.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>how do I join the group?</h3>
      <p class="wrapper--border-bottom">Join our Facebook page then contact us through chat, everything else is easy from there.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>is there a requirement for joining?</h3>
      <p class="wrapper--border-bottom">Not really. Politeness should be a given and when in doubt, be professional. 
        Other than that, learning HTML/CSS and Git/Github on your own would be great, 
        but even if you don't, feel free to join anyway.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>how do I join a project, exactly?</h3>
      <ul class="wrapper__text--indent wrapper__ul--deco-null">
        <li>First join the Facebook group and Github dev team.</li>
        <li>View the projects and their details on Github.</li>
        <li>See a project you like? Head back to the Facebook page and look for a poll.</li>
        <li>"Vote" for the project you like on the said poll.</li>
        <li>Admins will send you an invite on Github to join the specific project.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p class="wrapper--border-bottom">The process needs streamlining but we are working on it and if you want, 
        you can even help us out! :)</p>  
      <br>
      <h3>how do I submit a proposal?</h3>
      <p class="wrapper--border-bottom">To submit a proposal, you will have to join the Discord channel and choose the specific #project-proposal sub-channel. 
        Follow the template laid out there and simply submit. </p>
      <br>
      <h3>does the group have a preferred type of project?</h3>
      <p class="wrapper--border-bottom">For now, websites and web apps. Apart from that, it's a free for all. 
        Submit a project proposal and see how many people are interested in working on it.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>will I get paid?</h3>
      <p class="wrapper--border-bottom"> No. Long answer, we are all here to learn and practice so everything we work on is open-source.
          Of course once the project is done you can use the codes however you like and earn from there.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>can I ask your group to make something for free?</h3>
      <p class="wrapper--border-bottom">You can submit a proposal and see if people are interested, 
        though everything we work on is open source so it will be free for everyone and not just for you.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>can I commission your group to make me something?</h3>
      <p class="wrapper--border-bottom">Not as a group but for sure you can join the group and look for talent there.</p>
