        We are an open community of passionate learners from different backgrounds and experience levels. 
        We learn from each other regardless of who we are and actively encourage mentorship programs between our peers. 
        You are not alone in learning, join our Github community and view, learn or contribute to our open source projects and codes!    
        Everyone is welcome to share their ideas, propose a project or even become the lead for it if you want! 
        There are no hard rules on how projects are conducted or how teams are structured, it's all up to you and your group.
        To make it happen, you can send us a project proposal through Discord or via our Facebook group and if in case there's a need to make it clear, 
        we have ZERO tolerance for any form of harassment and discrimination.

        <!--editor's notes:
        minor edits like changed "experiences" to "experience levels" since "experience already conveys a similar thought to "backgrounds" while "experience levels" submits a message that some are beginners but some aren't.
        Concatenated some sentences and restructures some others for better flow, didn't change any meaning.
        Removed "most of us are self-taught" because we don't know if that is true and even if it is it might not be in the future.-->

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <h3>How do I join a project, exactly?</h3>
    <p>Join the FB group then "vote" for the current project polls. Voting for the project means you want to be a member of that project. For more details on the project, you will have to go to the GitHub page. It's not streamlined yet but we are working on it.
    </p>
    
    <h3>How do I submit a proposal?</h3>
    <p>
Join our discord! We have the channel #project-proposals and fill out this template:

Project Name: [What is your app or website called? ]
Description: [Describe your project and its features] 
Team requirements: [What roles do you need for that project and how many members?] 
Tech Tools to use: [What are the technologies you are going to use for your project?]
    </p>
    
    <h3>I want to help, how?</h3>
    <p>Voluntary Training Program by Mam Jem, help people get up to speed by leading projects for beginners. Teach Git/GitHub and usually HTML/CSS/JS frontend projects. If you want to help in some other way, please feel free to tell me personally (@paps in FB chat) so we can get you sorted out.
