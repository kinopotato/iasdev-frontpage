# iasdev-frontpage
Unofficial front page for IasDev team containing all the information needed for new members to get started.

v1: 
-Everything is working but still needs a lot of work on navigation, transition and layout to be honest.
-Break points are currently nonexistent. I worked with 13 inch 1366 x 720 screen, it looks passable there and slightly vomit inducing in everything else.
-Haven't checked for typos yet.
-I probably should make a changelog instead of putting this in the readMe.
-Needs some bling, no JS yet.
-For anyone reading this, the cat photo is a placeholder. . . but does anything else really deserve that spot
-Meta data is barebones.
